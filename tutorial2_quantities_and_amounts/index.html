    <p>Synopsis</p>
    <p>The Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan that was unveiled in 2007.  It is the successor to the Skyline GT-R, although no longer part of the Skyline range itself, that name now being used for Nissan's luxury-sport market.  Nissan's most performance oriented vehicle the GT-R, had only sold 331 units respectively, down from 538 of the entirety of 2018, resulting in a -38.5% figure.</p>
    <p>This may be due to market anticipation of a new model and a more focused group of buyers.</p>
