        <h2>What is the JDM Culture?</h2>
        The acronym JDM actually stands for Japanese Domestic Market, meaning things tuned and sold for the Japanese automotive standards. However it has now turned into a more generic acronym for the JDM culture.  JDM Culture is a part of the automotive universe that is slowly taking over the world. Much as the samurai in Japan's history, Japanese people today take very much pride in their domestic auto makers, and often choose their higher prices to the lower prices of imports. The sense of loyalty and pride they show carries over heavily to their car scene.  In other parts of the world such as United States we attempt to mimic through USDM models.  Skyline in Japan may have right hand drive and other JDM specific features vs USDM may be left hand drive and safety / trim features specific to US.  JDM culture is not a competition. It's not a rivalry. It's a philosophy, somewhat of a lifestyle, and even a religion for some people. It's not about who can mimic a lawn mower the best, or who has the most different colored panels on their car. It's about the bond between an entity and their car that brings out the best of them both, and brings them into a flourishing community of others who feel the same passion. Some say the JDM culture originated from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELJW-Bsrnmk">Kanjozoku</a> (video in link) group. Known to race on the Kanjo highway in Osaka Japan.  The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNNkd7VSBWE">Roulettezoku</a> is another good example of JDM culture in japan.  This JDM culture has flourished across the world.  Individuals importing vehicles from Japan - legally or illegally.  The JDM subculture has sprouted across world and has materialized in the form of public and secret meetings and other events.

          <h2>The Cars</h2>
          There are rivalries and competitions inside of the JDM Culture, and they're some of the biggest rivalries in the automotive world, like the big three of the Nissan Skyline, Toyota Supra, and the Mazda RX-7. After production of the RX-7 stopped, it became the Skyline vs Supra power struggle we know and love today, but RX-7 used to be a big challenger. But these rivalries don't define the culture. It doesn't matter who's the fastest or the best looking in the end, cause at the end of the day, we all want the same thing. We want to be surrounded by people who share a passion for the same things we do, and that's exactly what you get in the JDM Culture.

          Even within JDM there are different subcultures, activities, and utiliziation of these vehicles. Some that are notable or worth mentioning are Drifting, the art of controlled and sustained oversteer.  THe Kyusha which are classic japanese cars modified or not and Shakotan agressively modified classic vehicles.  Kaido racers and ‘Granchan’ style are colourful cars with the long exhaust pipes and wild, oversized body kits.  These cars are more commonly known as Kaido racers – ‘kaido’ meaning highway. This crazy style was partially inspired by the Super Silhouette racers from the Fuji Grand Champ street racing in Japan. From the mid 1980s and throughout the ’90s, street racing was perhaps the highlight of Japanese car culture. Perhaps the most well-known group of racers were the Mid Night Club, who became infamous for their illegal top speed races on the Wangan – the Bayshore Route of the Shuto Expressway running between Tokyo and Yokohama.  There are other notable like VIP that were assumingly associated to the Yakuza and other high end criminal organizations.

          Vehicles inclusive to the JDM culture such as ones listed in the table above has been met with an affinity around the world.  Many of these cars were dream cars for tuners and modders, and they still are. Tuners would rather work on a 1995 Supra than a 2020 Supra, for instance, because there are more options available. At the end of the day, these JDM cars from the ‘90s will outlast the popularity of the newest, greatest sports cars every time. They have more style, more character, and their legacies are much livelier.

          <h2>Future of the JDM Culture</h2>
          JDM Culture is here to stay.  However its integrity and quality points lies in socio economic status of afforability and purhasing power.  In the states many JDM vehicles that are illegal due to regulations are now meeting the 25 year classic vehicle mark.  Allowing for import and more leniant regulations.  There will be an influx stateside of these vehicles in the next few years.  Strengthening the JDM vehicle market and audience.
